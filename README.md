# Applied_LinearAlgebra
This project contains three problems that practice applied linear algebra (more details are included in "project instruction.pdf").

## Problem 1
Use linear transformation to transform the base pattern in "bird.npy".

## Problem 2
Use least-squares algorithm to measure the takeoff performance of an airplane.

## Problem 3
Use gradient descent and apply QR algoeithms to find the least square of the linear model to analyze the human weight/height dataset.
